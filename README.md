Nimrod argument parser
======================

As a long python user I believe the 2.x [optparse
module](http://docs.python.org/2/library/optparse.html) is one of the nicest
APIs to build command line interfaces. It's the only reason all my python
scripts have excelled in command line interfaces, because doing them right was
easy.

So going into [Nimrod](http://nimrod-code.org)'s [parseopt
module](http://nimrod-code.org/parseopt.html) is understandably a cold short
trip. And in the meantime, the twenty or thirty users of Python 3 have come up
with the [argparse module](http://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)
which adds some more flexibility to commandline parsing.

I believe the new argparse module can benefit from Nimrod's macros to build up
partially the command line parsing structures in compile time rather than
runtime. However, I also believe in conquering the world with the help of
[Pinky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinky_and_the_Brain), and that 2013 is
**the year of Nimrod**. So take my goal with a mountain of salt.

Oh, nearly forgot. This is empty, and nothing works. Please come back in
December for a treat to celebrate Christmas. In the meantime feel free to watch
some [Youtube videos](http://youtube.com/).
